# Project2_AllLifeBank
AllLife Bank is a US bank with a growing customer base. The bank is interested in expanding its borrower base so it can earn more through interest on loans. In this project, I analyze the data provided by AllLife Bank and build a machine-learning model to help the marketing department identify potential customers who are more likely to take personal loans.
